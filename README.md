Milestone 2 project



**STRATEGY**

The purpose of this project is to create a fun game and accessible game. The intended user — or player — is a smartphone user looking to occupy themselves in those in those moments in the day in which we have a few snatched minutes to kill. 

**User Stories**

* As a working 25-year old I spend a lot of time on public transport... or waiting for it to turn up. I'd like something to occupy me whilst I do that.

* As a parent of teenagers, I spend a lot my time running errands; waiting outside friends' houses to pick them up, for example. I always have my phone with me, so something I can do while I'm waiting would be great!

* As a young teen with an iPhone I'm looking for ways to avoid questions from my parents, and games that I can load instantly are a good way to look busy.

Essentially, this game aims to be a five-minute boredom-buster. As the user stories illustrate, there are many situations in everyday life that call for a few moments mindless escapism — queuing at the Post Office, for example — and this project aims to meet that need. It should be extremely quick to load, effortless to learn, and with a difficulty increase that does not frustrate, while still offering a developing level of challenge.

Above all it should be designed with a strictly mobile-first approach. It will, of course, be playable by iPad and laptop/desktop users, but it is expected that game play will be overwhelmingly via handheld devices in the situations outlined above.

There are a great many competitors in the market, of course, the most obvious among them being Two Dots:

Two Dots

An addictive puzzle game, Two Dots requires the player to match adjacent sequences of coloured dots to clear them from the board and meet a round-specific challenge. It's extremely accesible, with a gentle learning curve offers quick-to-access gameplay. However, as you progress, it does become significantly more challenging and strategy-based, making it less suitable for 5-minute, ad-hoc gameplay.

**SCOPE**

My project does not aim to compete with established apps as are mentioned above, which offer significant and deep levels of gameplay, building on years of development. The aim with this project is to create a simple puzzle game which could form the basis of a far larger development project in future. My game will work well, entertain the user, give the user what they're looking for (easy and quick access to simple gameplay), be simple to interact with and visually appealling. The feature list will therefore necessarily be far more conservative than a website project:

* Possible game features:

Simply puzzle game
Progression through levels based on success, with increasing difficulty
Top-score storage/player-acheivement memory
Touchscreen interactivity
Desktop (mouse/trackpad) interactivity
Desktop (keyboard) interactivity
Level-dependent design elements
Global scoreboard
Interaction with other players
Live multiplayer challenges
Bonus rounds (dependent on level acheived, or seasonal)

* Site/homepage features:
Developer contact information
Header/footer
Links to sister sites/games


Testing notes:

Expected behaviour: speed of appearance of flashes would vary, but still display consequtively. Found behaviour: very occassionally the timings would 'leapfrog' each other cause flashes to appear in the wrong order, thereby making it impossible for the user to correctly match the pattern through skill rather than luck.
